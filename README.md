# 447 Library Database Project
## Made by Team Orchid
This project was made for EECS 447 at KU in Spring 2025.

For meeting logs, go to [meeting-log.md](https://github.com/combs-a/447-orchid/blob/main/meeting-log.md).

## Statements

**Vision:** We are creating this project to provide a small library with the means to loan out and manage their items easily and efficiently.

**Scope:** The goal/objective of this project is to create a simple relational database, connected to a simple website that will allow users to log in.

The main features will be item lookup, account info access (borrowed books, overdue fees), restriction of certain materials based on account type (child vs. adult), and report creation (for both items and accounts).

The item types will include books, movies/tv, audiobooks, video games, and music. Account types will include child, teen, adult, senior, and staff. These account types will determine what items they can check out and how many, as well as their fee structures.
