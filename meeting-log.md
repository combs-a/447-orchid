**Notes:**

We discussed the requirements specifications and formalized definitions for various parts of the projects. We assigned work for the document to each person.

We made the decision to move to Discord, as Zoom has a 40-minute time limit on its meetings. Switching to Discord will make it easier to have longer meetings 

**Tasks Completed:**

Professor was asked the questions.
- Submission rules: Project Lead is the only person who submits the project work.
- phpMyAdmin: Can be used as long as there’s a deliverable on the Github as well
